# EnOcean4J Java Library
enocean4j is a fork of the [EnJ-Library](https://github.com/dog-gateway/enj-library) that takes a more generalised view of EnOcean protocol and how to work with it.
The codebase has been re-factored considerably to bring it into line with common patterns.

Some of the changes are listed below;
p
* Introduction of wide-scale logging using SL4J
* Large number of re-factors to improve code performance and bring it into line with standard Maven structure
* Hundreds of bug-fixes for static code issues and code correctness
* Replacement of the RxTxComm library with JSerialComm
* Added a new way in which the attribute notifications are handled so they are aggregated
* All Attribute notifications now also carry the device and telegram with them
* Separated the Device Management from the communications interface so that multiple comms devices can be deployed
* Dropped the persistent storage for registered devices (this should be the responsibility of the application)

The main driver for taking this on is the same as that for j2mod - we at 4NG have a need for an industrial grade protocol library for our SMARTset product and 
although EnJ-Library gets you a very long way forward, it doesn't meet our requirements.

The library has been tested on Windows and Linux, Raspbian using a USB300 dongle.

## Note
One of the things that this library does not support at the moment is OSGi bundling. This is for two reasons; 

1. JSerialComm is not packaged for OSGi
2. enocean4j uses package scanning to find all EEPs

When we've worked with the library a bit more, we will fix these issues.

Thanks to Dario Bonino and Andrea Biasi for all of their hard work on the original library at [e-lite](https://elite.polito.it/).

## For the impatient
```java
try {
    // create the lowest link layer
    LinkLayer linkLayer = new LinkLayer("com3");
    DeviceManager deviceManager = new DeviceManager();
    
    // create a device listener for handling device updates
    SimpleDeviceListener listener = new SimpleDeviceListener();
    deviceManager.addDeviceListener(listener);
    deviceManager.addDeviceValueListener(listener);    

    // register a rocker switch
    deviceManager.registerDevice("2BD5EE", "F60201");
    
    // create the connection layer
    Connection connection = new Connection(linkLayer, deviceManager);
    
    // connect the link
    linkLayer.connect();        
}
catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println("The given port does not exist or no device is plugged in" + e);
}
```

The device event listener
```java
public class SimpleDeviceListener implements DeviceListener {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SimpleDeviceListener.class);

    @Override
    public void addedEnOceanDevice(EnOceanDevice device) {
        logger.info("Added device: {} ({})", device.getAddressHex(), device.getEEP().getIdentifier());
    }

    @Override
    public void modifiedEnOceanDevice(EnOceanDevice device) {
        logger.info("Modified device: {} ({})", device.getAddressHex(), device.getEEP().getIdentifier());
    }

    @Override
    public void removedEnOceanDevice(EnOceanDevice device) {
        logger.info("Removed device: {} ({})", device.getAddressHex(), device.getEEP().getIdentifier());
    }

    @Override
    public void deviceAttributeChange(EEPAttributeChangeJob eepAttributeChangeJob) {
        for (EEPAttribute attr : eepAttributeChangeJob.getChangedAttributes()) {
            logger.info("Device: {} Channel: {} Attribute: {} Value: {}", eepAttributeChangeJob.getDevice().getAddressHex(), eepAttributeChangeJob.getChannelId(), attr.getName(), attr.getValue());
        }
    }
}
